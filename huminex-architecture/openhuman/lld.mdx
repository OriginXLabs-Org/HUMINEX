# OpenHuman Low-Level Design (LLD)

## Services

- `openhuman-gateway` (.NET 8): auth, session bootstrap, tenant/RBAC enforcement, signed upload URLs.
- `openhuman-orchestrator` (.NET 8 worker): interview state machine, tool calling, evaluation pipeline.
- `openhuman-transcript` (worker): transcript normalization, redaction, evidence extraction.
- `openhuman-evaluator` (worker): rubric scoring, calibration, bias checks, report generation.

## Data model (minimum)

- `InterviewSession` (tenantId, jobId, candidateId, status, startedAt, endedAt)
- `InterviewTurn` (sessionId, speaker, text, ts)
- `Rubric` (jobId, criteria JSON, weights)
- `EvaluationResult` (sessionId, criterion, score, evidenceRefs, modelMeta)
- `Artifact` (sessionId, blobUri, type, hash)
- `AuditEvent` (actor, action, resourceType, resourceId, outcome, metadata JSON)

## Integration contracts (HUMINEX)

- Publish `openhuman.interview.completed` event (Service Bus)
- HUMINEX consumes and writes:
  - ATS candidate stage update
  - evaluation summary + evidence links
