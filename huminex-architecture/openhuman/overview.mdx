# OpenHuman (Interview Intelligence Platform)

OpenHuman is HUMINEX's interview product: an enterprise-grade, agentic interview and evaluation system that can run structured interviews, produce evidence-backed scoring, and integrate results directly into HUMINEX recruiting/ATS and workforce onboarding flows.

## Core goals

- Consistent, rubric-based evaluation with auditable evidence.
- Tenant isolation and strict RBAC.
- Horizontal scalability (burst interviews) and cost controls.
- Easy integration with HUMINEX (ATS, onboarding, identity).
